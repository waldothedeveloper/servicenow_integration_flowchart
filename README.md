# ServiceNow Integration Decision Tree

This project is an interactive decision-making tool based on the original idea from [**Jochen Geist**](https://www.servicenow.com/community/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/399227), a ServiceNow employee. It aims to guide users through choosing the best integration pattern for connecting ServiceNow with third-party systems. By making this tool interactive, you can answer a series of questions and be guided through a decision tree to find the most suitable integration pattern.

Additionally, this project allows you to save your integration decisions and come back to review them at anytime.
